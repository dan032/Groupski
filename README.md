This project was used to familiarize myself with React Native and Firebase's Realtime database.

The idea of the project was to assist professors in the classroom if their course has a group presentation 
component where the students are evaluated by both the professor and their peers.

The professor can set up a classroom,where can then provide access to their students the ability to
form groups. When it comes time for marking, the application uses location services to ensure that the students
grading the presentation are actually present.

Once all the grades are collected, the final grade for each group is calculated. To ensure that students do not simply
give all of their peers perfect grades, any group that gives another group a grade that is 5% greater or less than the professor
will incure a penalty.
